# Example for ImperfectHuman/rule-based-system

Project mimicking the calculation of which adverts should appear on a website,
using a rule-based system, such as could be configured by a marketing team
to adjust the site's advertising strategy without requiring code changes.


## Main Purpose

To demonstrate a way you could use a [Rule-based system](https://github.com/ImperfectHuman/rule-based-system).

## Secondary Purpose

Also, to do some learning about React. This isn't likely to be good code or use
good practices. For example there's not likely to be a lot of (any?) tests. If
you're after an example of a rule based system, that shouldn't matter - just run
it.

## Running

```npm start```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
