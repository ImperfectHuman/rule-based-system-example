# Example for ImperfectHuman/rule-based-system

##Â Main Purpose

To demonstrate a way you could use a [Rule-based system](https://github.com/ImperfectHuman/rule-based-system).

## Secondary purpose

Also, to do some learning about React. This isn't likely to be good code or use
good practices. For example there's not likely to be a lot of (any?) tests. If
you're after an example of a rule based system, that shouldn't matter - just run
it.

## running

```npm start```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
